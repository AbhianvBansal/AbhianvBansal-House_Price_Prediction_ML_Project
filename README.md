# House_Price_Prediction_ML_Project
This is my first (learning) project using ML. 

Description:
  -> It predicts the price of a house depending on the values of attributes given.
  -> As it is a learning project i have taken less number of attributes some of them are house age, number of convenience stores, distance to the nearest MRT station, house        price of unit area.
  -> I have taken the dataset from the Real Estate Valuation site.
  -> For getting the minimum error between the actual price and the predicted price, I have tried various regression models on the dataset like linear regression, Random           forest regressor etc.
